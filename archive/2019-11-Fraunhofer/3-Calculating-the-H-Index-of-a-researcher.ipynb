The index is based on the set of the scientist's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications.\n","\n","A more precise definition:\n","\n","> The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author/journal has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times.\n","\n","How to calculate it:\n","\n","> Formally, if f is the function that corresponds to the number of citations for each publication, we compute the h-index as follows. First we order the values of f from the largest to the lowest value. Then, we look for the last position in which f is greater than or equal to the position (we call h this position). For example, if we have a researcher with 5 publications A, B, C, D, and E with 10, 8, 5, 4, and 3 citations, respectively, the h-index is equal to 4 because the 4th publication has 4 citations and the 5th has only 3. In contrast, if the same publications have 25, 8, 5, 3, and 3 citations, then the index is 3 because the fourth paper has only 3 citations ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"Collapsed":"false","colab_type":"text","id":"hWgUrUXmFbWt"},"source":["## Load libraries and log in"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"Collapsed":"false","colab_type":"code","executionInfo":{"elapsed":6166,"status":"ok","timestamp":1573850824332,"user":{"displayName":"Michele Pasin","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBu8LVjIGgontF2Wax51BoL5KFx8esezX3bUmaa0g=s64","userId":"10309320684375994511"},"user_tz":300},"id":"LJ74BqSVVyf8","outputId":"3abe3793-5a6b-4705-90e1-c71c8624540f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":50}},"source":["# @markdown # Get the API library and login \n","# @markdown **Privacy tip**: leave the password blank and you'll be asked for it later.
