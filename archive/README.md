# Archive: Events and Demos Notebooks

This folder contains copies of notebooks used for public workshops and tutorials.

Most often, these are customized versions of the generic notebook templates (in the `cookbooks` folder), focusing on a specific institution or audience. 

**Note** 
The notebooks in this folder are simply *archived* for future reference but are not normally tested afterwards. 

Please use the materials in the `cookbooks` folder for up to date examples and reusable templates.
