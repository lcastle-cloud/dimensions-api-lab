# Visual Basic Example

The `Dimensions_VB_Example.vb` file in this folder replicates the getting-started example provided in the [documentation](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/api.html). 

Itâ€™s slightly more verbose than the Python one but should run fine on most set-ups as a .NET console application project.
